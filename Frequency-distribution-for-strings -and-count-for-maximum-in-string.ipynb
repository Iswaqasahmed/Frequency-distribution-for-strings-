      "The seventh edition of Digital Principles and Applications continues with the upgradation of the work started in its previous edition. The job was to build upon the strengths of one of the best introductory and authentic texts in the field of Digital Electronics-its lucid language, down-to-earth approach, detailed analysis and ready-to-use information for laboratory practices. The sixth edition sought improvement primarily by (i) strengthening the design or synthesis aspect that included advanced material, such as a simple computer design, and (ii) incorporating many new topics like Hardware Description Language, Asynchronous Sequential Circuit, Algorithm State Machine chart, Quine-McClusky algorithm, Look Ahead Carry Adder, etc. exit \n",
